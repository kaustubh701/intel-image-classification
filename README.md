# intel-image-classification
The goal of the project is to predict the categories of the image. We have classified the images into 6 categories buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street.
I have build the model with Convolutional neural network and residual neural network.I have made my model with 17 layers which consists of 8 convolutional neural network ,4 residual neural network(which consists of 2 convolutional neuaral network each) and one linear neural network.The model can be also trained on GPU as i have used Pytorch library. I achieved a accuracy of 0.9083 from the model.
